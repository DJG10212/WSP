	<h1> Dakota Gillette </h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Dakota Gillette and I am a Web Design and Development student at Full Sail University. I am currently taking the Web Standards Project course, and we are compiling a list web components which we will recreate throughout this class. Listed below are the components I have selected.</p>

<!--header-->
<img  src="images/header.png" alt="header" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
	<p>The site was designed for an agency or design company. The target audience would most likely be for other businesses, and business owners, so most likely people 25 years and up. Generally a company looking for a design agency will be an established business, or one with decent funding.</p>
<br>

	<h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
	<p>The client needs people to easily navigate across the site, and the user needs to be able to read the navigation tabs. The user also needs the current page to be highlighted, so they have an easy point of reference as to what page they are currently on.</p>
<br>

	<h3>Critique:</h3>
	<p>The navbar design is very clean and modern. The sans serif font helps with the modern feel, while the all caps helps to relay their importance. The red block makes it very easy to know what page you are on, and helps create an awareness of your current page location. It is very bold, but still has a very metro modern feel. Red is also a great color for grabbing the users attention.</p>

<!--team-->
<img  src="images/team.png" alt="team" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience for the team members section is again most likely for a business, and someone who is 25 years and up. The team section is primarily for someone who is interesteded in the site, and is considering hiring the team. They will visit this section to help them make the final decision.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>This section helps the client have a "human" element to their website. It helps them convey to the user who they actually are. It's important for the pictures to show happy, smiling people, that make the user attracted to the page. The user will go to this section to help them make a final decision on hiring the agency.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>Overall this is a great way to display your team. The design has a simple header with some slightly lighter sub text. There are bright buttons that are used to filter the results of the team members. The pictures are setup in a grid with 4 pictures. The team members name is displayed in black, while their job description is displayed in a smaller, and lighter font. Overall it's a very simple, and symmetrical design.</p>

<!--contact-->
<img  src="images/contact.png" alt="contact" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>This page is catering towards people seeking more information. It could essentially work for any age range, as it's a fairly generic contact form. Generally contact forms are used for two different groups of people. Those seeking more information becasue they are interested in the sites product/service, and people who are confused or need help.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client needs a well designed, and simple contact form, so they are able to answer customer questions, so that they do not lose sales. The user needs an easy to use contact form, that is simple enough, that they are willing to fill it out. The user also needs a phone number, email address, and location (when applicable).</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This contact form splits the page roughly in half. The color used is a turquoise blue, which is genrally used to convey clarity of thought, which can be useful in a contact form. The left side has a simple, and welcoming message asking the user to contact them. There are only three fields to fill out, which is also welcoming to the user, as you can fill out the form in a matter of seconds. The right side of the page is a unique design. The background image is of a city, presumably the city in which the company is located. Over it, there is a turquoise transparent layer. All of the companies relevant contact information is displayed, with the useful information being larger, and displayed in white which contrasts well on the turquoise background.</p>
