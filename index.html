	<h1> Dakota Gillette </h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Dakota Gillette and I am a Web Design and Development student at Full Sail University. I am currently taking the Web Standards Project course, and we are compiling a list web components which we will recreate throughout this class. Listed below are the components I have selected.</p>

<!--header-->
<img  src="images/header.png" alt="header" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
	<p>The site was designed for an agency or design company. The target audience would most likely be for other businesses, and business owners, so most likely people 25 years and up. Generally a company looking for a design agency will be an established business, or one with decent funding.</p>
<br>

	<h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
	<p>The client needs people to easily navigate across the site, and the user needs to be able to read the navigation tabs. The user also needs the current page to be highlighted, so they have an easy point of reference as to what page they are currently on.</p>
<br>

	<h3>Critique:</h3>
	<p>The navbar design is very clean and modern. The sans serif font helps with the modern feel, while the all caps helps to relay their importance. The red block makes it very easy to know what page you are on, and helps create an awareness of your current page location. It is very bold, but still has a very metro modern feel. Red is also a great color for grabbing the users attention.</p>
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<!--END header-->

<!--team-->
<img  src="images/team.png" alt="team" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience for the team members section is again most likely for a business, and someone who is 25 years and up. The team section is primarily for someone who is interesteded in the site, and is considering hiring the team. They will visit this section to help them make the final decision.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>This section helps the client have a "human" element to their website. It helps them convey to the user who they actually are. It's important for the pictures to show happy, smiling people, that make the user attracted to the page. The user will go to this section to help them make a final decision on hiring the agency.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>Overall this is a great way to display your team. The design has a simple header with some slightly lighter sub text. There are bright buttons that are used to filter the results of the team members. The pictures are setup in a grid with 4 pictures. The team members name is displayed in black, while their job description is displayed in a smaller, and lighter font. Overall it's a very simple, and symmetrical design.</p>
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<!--END team-->

<!--contact-->
<img  src="images/contact.png" alt="contact" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>This page is catering towards people seeking more information. It could essentially work for any age range, as it's a fairly generic contact form. Generally contact forms are used for two different groups of people. Those seeking more information becasue they are interested in the sites product/service, and people who are confused or need help.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client needs a well designed, and simple contact form, so they are able to answer customer questions, so that they do not lose sales. The user needs an easy to use contact form, that is simple enough, that they are willing to fill it out. The user also needs a phone number, email address, and location (when applicable).</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This contact form splits the page roughly in half. The color used is a turquoise blue, which is genrally used to convey clarity of thought, which can be useful in a contact form. The left side has a simple, and welcoming message asking the user to contact them. There are only three fields to fill out, which is also welcoming to the user, as you can fill out the form in a matter of seconds. The right side of the page is a unique design. The background image is of a city, presumably the city in which the company is located. Over it, there is a turquoise transparent layer. All of the companies relevant contact information is displayed, with the useful information being larger, and displayed in white which contrasts well on the turquoise background.</p>
</div>

<!--END contact-->

<!--features-->
<img  src="images/features.png" alt="features" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience is somone, or a business looking for a responsive web template. Generally anyone from the ages of 20+, looking for a website template. The template isrelatively cheap, but looks great. It could easily apply to anyone, in any economic standing. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client needs to show off the design of their website. They are giving relevant information pertaining to their template, but also including filler text, to leave things to the users imagination. This is one of the first things that a user sees, so it needs to be designed well, and intrigue their interest in the template, by having relevant information relayed to them.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>The design is very minimal, but looks exceptionally well. The color blue is often used to convey honesty and trustworthiness, which is essential in a product being sold. The design follows a similiar pattern as my last component. The header text is larger, and a darker color. The sub text is smaller, and a lighter grey. The icons are a great addition to this features section, and they really bring the design together. It's following a grid design, and the icons can be utilized well on mobile devices.</p>

<img  src="images/work.png" alt="our work" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Gallery</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience is someone looking for professional photography. It could range from someone looking for portraits, to a business needing product images. Generally anyone over the age of 20, that needs a professional photographer. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client needs a unique way to display their images in a gallery. Their goal is to convince the user to hire them, so the images need to look good, as well as the gallery. The user is looking at the gallery to detirmine if they want to hire this specific photographer. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This is a very beautifully designed gallery. The images are displayed in a nice grid. Everything is very symmetrical, and the images pop, as the gallery has a very minimalistic design. The header text is very unobtrusive, which brings the focus to the images rather than the text.</p>

<!--reviews-->
<br>
<img  src="images/review.png" alt="reviews" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Quotes/Reviews</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience can be literally anyone, of almost any age. It's just a generic quote section, that can be used on any website.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>A client could use this section for inspirational quotes, or for reviews of their product/service. They can use it to help inspire, or give confidence to the user. The user needs this section to help instill trust of the product/service. If other people like it, they most likely will as well.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This is a great design for a review section on a website, most likely used for some sort of agency or design service. The background is intriguing, but is muted enough so that it isn't the focus. The red quote marks, and name are great for grabbing your attention. The large white text is a good contrast on the dark background. This section was an image slider, that rotated in new quotes every so often. It is a great way to grab a users attention, and help them gain trust in your company.</p>

<!--social-->
<br>
<img  src="images/social.png" alt="social" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Social Feed</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The use of a social network feed ( specifically Instagram ) will most likely be for a younger audience. anyone between the ages of 12 to 30.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client will use this social feed to gain followers on their social page. A social page is great for communicating and relating with your customers, to give your company a more human touch. Social sites are also a great way to advertise to people interested in your product/service, for free. The users will like this feature, as it gives them a way to easily connect with the company, and see current events, specials, etc.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This is a great take on a social feed. The images from the Instagram account are displayed, so the user get a sense of what content is posted. The great part though, is that they are somewhat muted by the black transparency layer above it. This helps to interest the user, but they actually have to go the the social page to see the images in full. The clients profile image is shown with some information about their page. There is also a large "Follow" button to help entice users to follow the account. There aren't really any colors to mention, and the font is rather small. It takes on a very minimalist design, which could be a positive, or a negative.</p>

<!--skills-->
<br>
<img  src="images/skills.png" alt="skills" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Skills</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>A business looking to hire an agency or company. Generally someone over the age of 25. The business is most likely well established, and willing to pay for good service.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>The client uses this area to display their skills in certain fields. This helps convey their confidence, and skill level to users looking to hire them. The user will look to this area to see if the agency meets their requirements. If they are proficient in all required fields, the user will most likely contact the agency/company and inquire about work.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>The design is split down the middle. Their is information on the left, and the skill charts on the right. The use of a muted text is an interesting choice, but may be to bring the focus to the bright red skill bars. These easily grab your attention, and are definitely the focus of the section. </p>

<!--pricing tables-->
<br>
<img  src="images/price.png" alt="tables" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Pricing Tables</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>The target audience is any user interested in buying the product. They can be used for a wide variety of things, therefore the age and social class of the user can vary greatly.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>Clients will use pricing tables to relay their exact prices to the user. They will try to have as enticing of information as they can, in order to get the user to buy their product. The users will use pricing tables to easily compare the different levels of the product. They are great for comparing information, and making a final decision.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>This is a great example of a simple, yet efficient pricing table. The most commonly used, or best deal, is highlighted to entice users. The red numbers and buttons are great for attracting attention. The titles are bold and in all caps, to show their importance, but not enough to overpower the prices. The features are all displayed inline with each other, to make it easy for comparing between each table. Less relevant information is displayed outside of the pricing tables, to show that they are less important. The most important part, the "Sign Up" buttons are displayed large, in order to entice users to click them.</p>
</div>
<br>

<!--footer-->
<br>
<img  src="images/footer.png" alt="footer" align="center" width="95%" height="auto">
<div class="text">
	<h2>Footer</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <p>Generally for people who are confused, or looking for contact info and social media sites. Applies to all ages, and any demographics.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
    <p>Clients need a footer, as they often have very important information. The users use footers to find anything from contact info, social media sites, and general "About Us" information. There are often links to the main pages, which can be helpful for a confused user.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Critique:</h3>
    <p>Grey is often a neutral color, and is great for a footer, as it doesn't stand out. The majority of the font and icons on the footer are a grey, in order to not draw attention, unless you are specifically seeking the information. The footer is broken into three segments, with relevant information in each. The titles stand out ever so slightly, because they are larger, and a white color. The only real "exciting" part of the footer is the top orange stripe which makes it more intriguing, while still profossionally relaying the proper information below.</p>
